Deobfusacte Azur Lane scripts bundle.

Requirements:
Salt assembly from Azur Lane game data (com.YoStarEN.AzurLane\main.544.com.YoStarEN.AzurLane\assets\Salt inside the obb bundle).

Building:
Copy Salt assembly to working directory and rename to Salt.dll
csc /reference:Salt.dll deobf.cs

Usage:
deobf <obfuscated scripts path> <deobfuscated scripts path>

Notes:
The game scripts live at com.YoStarEN.AzurLane\main.544.com.YoStarEN.AzurLane\assets\AssetBundles\scripts inside the obb bundle. This file is obfuscated with a simple obfuscation scheme that cycles between TEA, XTEA, XXTEA, and xor'ing, all with a hardcoded key. After deobfuscation, the scripts file is a Unity AssetBundle.
